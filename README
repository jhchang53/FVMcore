=== T/H ===
cond3d.cpp - 3D conduction-convection 

segcond - 1D conduction - heat tranfer at wall

segmult - multiple solution of segcond

tricond - 1D triso conduction problem : enfroce Tavg = 0

trimult - multiple solution of tricond

=== Neutron ===
cappsimple - simple eigenvalue problem for CAPP
	print axial flux
cappworth - critcality along control rod position

capptcoef - criticality along Tm, Tf variation

cappkin - delayed neutron transient

=== Combined ===
cappcomp - solve neutron - TH with fuel segment (w/o) TRISO
  * this is recommendable 
cappdyn - solve neutron - TH with segment and TRISO
  * this is unstable and requires too small time step.

== aux. programs ==
thproflow - check flow properties
thprocond - check thermal properties
mpwork - check MPwork class

geomcapp - check geometry

etricond - simple 1 triangle prism problem
etriseg - simple TH with Core3D and SegCond

coredesc - Core description class to obtain required parameters
